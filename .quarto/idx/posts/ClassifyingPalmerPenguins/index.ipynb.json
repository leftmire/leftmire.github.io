It contains Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Long Term Ecological Research Network's observations of hundreds of Antartic penguins belonging to 3 species groups: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.\n\nThis blog aims to accomplish three goals: \n\n1. Conduct exploration of the Palmer Penguins dataset\n\n2. Methodically select 3 features and a model type that produces 100% penguin species classification accuracy on test data\n\n3. Evaluate chosen model by analyzing decision regions and a confusion matrix\n\n### Random Exploration\n\nThe training data contains 18 observations about 275 penguin subjects. Let's clean this data by dropping irrelevent columns and one-hot encoding the qualitative observations.\n\nVisualizations\n\nThis histogram shows the distribution of the penguins' flipper lengths. The bars are colored based on penguin species, so the shape of the distributions allow the viewer to infer the mean, medians, and modes for each species. There is a trend in flipper length based on species: Gentoo penguins tend to have the largest flippers, and Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have smaller ones. This indicates that flipper length may be a helpful feature to use in classification, as it effectively identifies the Gentoo penguins from the rest of the species.\n\nAfter considering multiple combinations of qualitative features in scatterplots, body mass and culmen length proved to show clear groupings of penguin species. Therefore, these two features are likely to be effective in a classification model. That being said, overlap does exist, especially between Adelie and Gentoo penguins.\n\nThis summary table shows the numbers of penguins present on each island. Every penguin on Torgersen island is an Adelie penguin, and both Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins can only be found on one island. These clear trends cause me to consider island location as a potential feature in a classification model. \n\n![cite: https://en.ac-illust.com/clip-art/22518802/illustration-of-a-cute-penguins-playing-a-computer](penguin_computer.jpg)\n\n### Choosing Features\n\nBecause there were only 5 qualitative and 6 quantitative feature in the cleaned dataset, I chose to perform an exhaustive search to determine the most effective features and model for species classification. For each combination of 2 quantitative and 1 qualitative feature, I fit 4 models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM. Cross validation was performed to guard against overfitting as follows: \n\n1. Logistic Regression: recorded average accuracy of 5 rounds, each round with a random 20% of data used for testing\n2. Decision Tree and Random Forest: performed grid search of varrying max_depth values, recorded highest accuracy achieved\n3. SVM: performed grid search of varrying gamma values, recorded highest accuracy achieved\n\nFor each model, the features, model type, and highest possible score was added to a dataframe. Sorting this dataframe by score revealed that Logistic Regression with Sex, Culmen Length and Culmen Depth as features produced the best classification.\n\n![citation: https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-d-penguin-teaches-math-render-numbers-image45736629](penguin_with_numbers.jpg){width=50%}\n\n### Evaluate Chosen Model\n\nTo truly evaluate our model, we must evaluate how it performs on unseen testing data.\n\nA score of 1.0 indicates that 100% of the penguins in the testing dataset were correctly classified by our model. Yippie!\n\nStepping back a little, let's consider: does this make sense? Should we be able to determine a penguin species based on its sex, culmen length, and culmen depth? \n\nYes, it seems logical that different species of penguins have different culmen dimensions. I am also not surprised that sex is an important qualitative feature to consider, as penguin size, and consequently beak dimensions, vary based on sex. For example, female Gentoo penguins may have similar culmen lengths to a male Adelie, so sex is required to determine species.\n\nTo be sure, let's create a scatterplot of these 3 features and look at the decision regions produced by our logistic algorithm.\n\nFor the training data: \n\nFor the testing data: \n\nYes, separating penguins by sex creates very clear clusters of points by species in the testing data, which transfers perfectly to the points in the testing data. \n\nAnother way to evaluate would be to look at a confusion matrix for this model\n\nZero penguins were mis-classified. This makes sense because we got our logistic regression model had an accuracy of 1.0!\n\nThe plot below is another way to visualize the confusion matrix. For an accuracy of 1.0, we would expect zeros in every box execept for those on the diagonal, meaning that zero penguins were misclassified.\n\n### Discussion\n\nIn this blog post, I aimed to explore the popular Palmer Penguins dataset and build a classification model that could correctly determine the species of every penguin in unseen data. In accomplishing these goals, I created two new visualizations and summary table, developing skills using pandas functions and matplotlib. I also practiced selecting features for a model by testing feature combinations on 4 model types -- logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and SVM. I optimized each model using cross validation and grid search for optimal hyperparameters, and evaluated each model based on accuracy.\n\nOnce I had settled on the best features and best model type, I evaluated my model on unseen testing data and achieved the desired result -- 100% classification accuracy! I created and interperated a confusion matrix, which corroborated my high accuracy result. \n\nThe skills I learned in this blog post will surely serve me well as I move into understanding and developing more complex models. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nCSCI 0451\n\n# Classifying Palmer Penguins\n\n![cite: https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/palmerpenguins-cran/](penguin3.jpg)\n\nThe Palmer Penguins dataset is a public dataset frequently used within the educational data science community.
